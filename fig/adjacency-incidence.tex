\caption{A simple undirected graph with vertex set $V=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ and edge set
$E=\{e_{12},e_{23},e_{34},e_{41},e_{25},e_{56},e_{36}\}$.
\textbf{Adjacency (vertex--vertex):} vertices $1$ and $2$ are adjacent because $e_{12}$ joins them; vertices $1$ and $3$ are not adjacent because there is no edge between them.
\textbf{Incidence (edge--vertex):} edge $e_{12}$ is incident to vertices $1$ and $2$ (and is not incident to $3$); the edges incident to vertex $2$ are $e_{12}$, $e_{23}$, and $e_{25}$.}
