\caption{A directed graph that is \emph{weakly connected} (ignoring arrow directions, all vertices lie in one connected component) but \emph{not strongly connected} (there is no directed path from $6$ back to earlier vertices, and no directed path from $\{4,5\}$ back to $\{1,2,3\}$). The strongly connected components are highlighted: \textcolor{blue}{$\{1,2,3\}$}, \textcolor{green}{$\{4,5\}$}, and \textcolor{orange}{$\{6\}$}.}
