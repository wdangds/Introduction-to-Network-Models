\caption{A disconnected graph with three connected components:
\textcolor{blue}{$\{1,2,5,7\}$}, \textcolor{red}{$\{3,6\}$}, and \textcolor{green}{$\{4\}$}.
The subgraph on $\{3,4,6\}$ is not connected because vertex $4$ is isolated from $\{3,6\}$, while the subgraph on $\{1,2,5\}$ is not maximal since it can be enlarged to the connected component $\{1,2,5,7\}$.}
