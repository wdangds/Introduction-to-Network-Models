# Introduction to Network Models — Chapter summaries

This repository contains the start of a short book on network models. Below are concise summaries of the first two chapters and a brief roadmap for continuing the text.

## Chapter 1 — Introduction to Network Models

Chapter 1 motivates the study of networks and introduces the basic vocabulary and intuition. It shows where networks appear (social ties, information systems, markets, infrastructure), explains the difference between structural connectedness (who is linked to whom) and behavioral connectedness (how actions and incentives propagate), and introduces key terms: nodes, edges, paths, degree, neighborhoods, components, and diameter. The chapter also sketches core phenomena such as cascades, network effects, and the interplay between structure and strategic behavior.

## Chapter 2 — Mathematics of Networks

Chapter 2 develops the formal tools used to represent and reason about network structure. Topics include the adjacency matrix (undirected, directed, weighted), degree and connectance, basic matrix identities, and definitions used to study connectivity and robustness: components, vertex- and edge-connectivity, minimum degree, and how these measures relate to network resilience.

## Roadmap / Keep-writing plan

- Chapter 3 — Graph algorithms & measures (centrality, clustering, shortest paths).
- Chapter 4 — Random graph models and generative processes (Erdos–Renyi, preferential attachment).
- Chapter 5 — Dynamics on networks (epidemics, threshold/adoption models, opinion dynamics).
- Appendices: exercises, suggested datasets, and brief algorithm reference.
