# Chapter 1 — Introduction to Network Models

A concise, conceptual introduction to why networks matter and the basic tools for reasoning about them. Chapter 1 introduces the language of graphs, contrasts structure and behavior, and surveys core phenomena that arise in social, information, and economic networks.

Key takeaways:

- Networks appear everywhere: social ties, information systems, markets, and infrastructure. Their structure shapes how things spread and how individuals influence outcomes.
- Basic graph vocabulary: nodes, edges, paths, walks, degree, neighborhoods, connected components, and diameter.
- Important distinctions: undirected vs directed graphs; simple vs weighted/multigraphs; local measures (degree) vs global measures (connectivity, diameter).
- Dynamics and strategic behavior: diffusion, information cascades, network effects, and how game-theoretic reasoning (e.g., Nash equilibrium) applies when payoffs depend on neighbors.

Keep-writing plan (placeholders you can expand):

- Chapter 2 — Graph algorithms & measures (centrality, clustering, shortest paths).
- Chapter 3 — Random graph models and generative processes (Erdos–Renyi, preferential attachment).
- Chapter 4 — Dynamics on networks (epidemics, threshold/adoption models, opinion dynamics).
- Exercises and suggested datasets for hands-on practice.

If you want, I can shorten this further (one-paragraph abstract), or generate a simple chapter roadmap file listing tentative topics and exercises for each upcoming chapter.
